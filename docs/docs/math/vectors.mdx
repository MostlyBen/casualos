In CasualOS, Vectors are useful objects that represent 2D/3D positions and directions.
They are called vectors because in Math it is common to call an ordered list of numbers a "vector".

Additionally, they are useful because we can use vectors to represent X, Y, and Z positions and perform common operations on them like adding them together or finding the distance between them.

There are two classes that provide vector functionality:

-   `Vector2` provides 2D vectors.
-   `Vector3` provides 3D vectors.

## `Vector2`

`Vector2` is a class that is able to represent 2D positions and directions.
It has two properties: `x`, and `y` which contain their respective coordinates.

<ClassMembers name='Vector2' anchorRoot='vector2' />

## `Vector3`

`Vector3` is a class that is able to represent 2D positions and directions.
It has three properties: `x`, `y`, and `z` which contain their respective coordinates.

<ClassMembers name='Vector3' anchorRoot='vector3' />
