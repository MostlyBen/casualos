This page provides a glossary of common terms and words along with short descriptions.

### AUX

_AUX commonly stands for **A**utomatic **U**ser **E**xperience but it can also stand for **A**mbient **U**ser **E**xperience._

AUX (pronounced "awks") is a term that we use to talk about an computer system that provides access to an interactive model for multiple people across multiple devices and geographic locations.
This means that AUXes are designed to work on a wide variety of devices (phones, laptops, VR headsets, etc.), and they remain synced regardless of where in the world you are.

With respect to CasualOS, every [inst](#instance) is an AUX because CasualOS does the hard work to ensure that everything is synced and works across all connected devices.

You may also come across the term "AUX File". AUX files are files that use the `.aux` filename extension and contain [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) formatted bots.
Usually, AUX files are utilized as an easy way to save/load [bots](#bot) from an inst.

### ab-1

ab-1 is a set of [bots](#bot) that augment the built-in CasualOS [portals](#portal) and behavior to make authoring experiences easier.
When an [instance](#instance) is started, ab-1 is automatically loaded for convience.

### Bot

Bots are containers of data and behavior. Bots live in [instances](#instance) and each bot has a unique identifier.
Additionally, a bot contains one or more [tags](#tag) that define the properties and behavior of the bot.

### CasualOS

[CasualOS](https://casualos.com/) a website that makes it easy to author [AUXes](#aux) and share them with other people.

CasualOS is maintained by a non-profit company called [Casual Simulation](https://casualsimulation.org/) and is free for anyone to use.
The [source code](https://github.com/casual-simulation/casualos) for CasualOS is [MIT Licensed](https://github.com/casual-simulation/casualos/blob/develop/LICENSE.txt) and can be copied and reused for free by anyone.

### Dimension

Dimensions are the names of [tags](#tag) that are used by [bots](#bot) in the [instance](#instance).
They are most commonly used by portals to show only some of the bots in the instance in the portal.

For example if you have three bots and two of them have the `#home=true` tag,
you can use the `home` dimension with a portal to show only the bots that have the `#home=true` tag.

### Instance

An instance (also known as an inst) is a shared simulation of bots hosted on CasualOS.

### Portal

Portals are places where humans can interface with [bots](#bot).
Portals utilize [dimensions](#dimension) to allow interacting with and visualizing subsets of bots.

A list of built-in portals is available on the [`configBot` documentation](../tags.mdx#config-bot-tags).

### Tag

Tags are pairs of names and their corresponding values. Each tag lives in a bot and represents an attribute of the bot.
For example if a bot has a tag named `color`, and that tag has the value `blue`, then we would say that bot has `#color` set to `blue`. ("the color tag is set to blue")

In CasualOS, tags are used to store data as well as a way to program automations that respond to user actions.
CasualOS has predefined automations for some tags. We call these tags "built-in tags" and they can be used to quickly decorate bots or control some of their behavior. 
For example, the <TagLink tag='color'/> tag can be used to change the color that a bot is displayed with while the <TagLink tag='label'/> tag can be used to show a text label on a bot.
